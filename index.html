            <p class="card">The <strong>Solar System</strong> is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. There are 8 planets in our Solar System. The four inner system planets are <strong>Mercury</strong>, <strong>Venus</strong>, <strong>Earth</strong>, and <strong>Mars</strong> are terrestrial planets. The four giant planets of the outer system are <strong>Jupiter</strong>, <strong>Saturn</strong>, <strong>Uranus</strong>, and <strong>Neptune</strong>.</p>

                <p>The <strong>Sun</strong> is the star at the center of the Solar System. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99,86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Its surface has a temperature of about 6000 degree Celcius, and it is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>

                <p><strong>Pluto</strong> is <q>dwarf planet</q> in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared the ninth planet from the Sun. However, beginning in the 90s, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similiar size in the Kuiper Belt and the scattered disc, including the dwarf planet Eris, leading the <q>International Astronomical Union</q> (IAU) in 2006 to define the <em>term planet</em> formally excluding Pluto and reclassifying it as a dwarf planet.</p>
